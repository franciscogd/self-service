If the Customer is a “consumer” for the purposes of the Consumer Rights Law (Legislative Decree no. 206/2005, Codice Del Consumo, hereinafter also “CRL”), the consumer will be entitled to contact Talend at the address and with the means of communications indicated in this Agreement, in relation to possible complaints. In light of the circumstance that the main subject of this Agreement is the supply of the Talend Software, according to article 59 of the CRL the right of withdrawal provided by the CRL is not be applicable. 
12.9.2 Guarantee in favor of the Consumer.  If the Customer is a consumer, our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Italian Consumer Law. In particular Talend guarantees that the goods delivered to the consumer are in conformity with the Agreement. Consumer goods are presumed to be in conformity with the contract if they: (a) comply with the description given by the seller and possess the qualities of the goods which the seller has held out to the consumer as a sample or model; (b) are fit for any particular purpose for which the consumer requires them and which he made known to the seller at the time of conclusion of the contract and which the seller has accepted; (c) are fit for the purposes for which goods of the same type are normally used; (d) show the quality and performance which are normal in goods of the same type and which the consumer can reasonably expect, given the nature of the goods and taking into account any public statements on the specific characteristics of the goods made about them by the seller, the producer or his representative, particularly in advertising or on labelling. There shall be deemed not to be a lack of conformity for the purposes of this paragraph if, at the time the Agreement was concluded, the consumer was aware, or could not reasonably be unaware of, the lack of conformity, or if the lack of conformity has its origin in materials supplied by the consumer.
12.9.3 Consumer’s Rights. Talend is liable to the consumer for any lack of conformity which exists at the time the goods are delivered. In the case of a lack of conformity, the consumer shall be entitled to have the goods brought into conformity free of charge by repair or replacement or to have an appropriate reduction made in the price or the contract rescinded with regard to those goods. The consumer may require Talend to repair the goods or he/she may require Talend to replace them, in either case free of charge, unless this is impossible or disproportionate. A remedy shall be deemed to be disproportionate if it imposes costs on Talend which, in comparison with the alternative remedy, are unreasonable, taking into account: (i) the value the goods would have if there were no lack of conformity, (ii) the significance of the lack of conformity, and (iii) whether the alternative remedy could be completed without significant inconvenience to the consumer. Any repair or replacement shall be completed within a reasonable time and without any significant inconvenience to the consumer, taking account of the nature of the goods and the purpose for which the consumer required the goods. The above mentioned terms "free of charge" refer to the necessary costs incurred to bring the goods into conformity, particularly the cost of postage, labour and materials. The consumer may require an appropriate reduction of the price or have the contract rescinded: (i) if the consumer is entitled to neither repair nor replacement, or (ii) if the seller has not completed the remedy within a reasonable time, or (iii) if the seller has not completed the remedy without significant inconvenience to the consumer. The consumer is not entitled to have the contract rescinded if the lack of conformity is minor.
12.9.4 Consumer’s Rights Time limits. Talend shall be held liable under 12.8.3 herein above where the lack of conformity becomes apparent within two years as from delivery of the goods. The consumer must inform Talend of the lack of conformity within a period of two months from the date on which he detected such lack of conformity.
12.9.5 According to Article 141-sexies, Paragraph 3 of CRL, Talend herewith informs the consumer that in the event that a consumer’s compliant to Talend has not been settled the dispute, Talend will provide the consumer with information relevant to the Alternative Dispute Resolution (“ADR”) body that will provide assistance in order to attempt to achieve an extrajudicial settlement of the dispute concerning the Agreement (according to articles 141-bis and following of the CRL).

The consumer will be entitled to file a claim before the Court in relation to this Agreement regardless of the outcome of the captioned extrajudicial settlement procedures.
